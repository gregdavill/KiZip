# 2-click gerber/drill export plugin for KiCad
![icon](icons/zip.png)

This Action plugin makes the task of exporting and zipping up gerbers and drill files for PCB manufactures, quick and easy. With just two clicks from the pcbnew window.

This plugin aims to be simple to install and use. Due to current limitation with the KiCad scripting engine it only covers gerber/drill files.
